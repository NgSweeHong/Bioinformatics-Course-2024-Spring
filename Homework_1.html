# Bioinformatics Lecture 1
- **Textook:** [Bioinformatics Tutorial](https://book.ncrnalab.org/teaching/)

## What To Learn
1. Programming Skill
...- Linux, R, Python (Optional)
2. NGS Data Analysis
3. Machine Learning

## Science
### This Course Try To Answer:
- Why Do Humans Have So Few Genes?
- To What Extent Are Genetic Variation and Personal Health Linked?

### Gene: Coding & Noncoding
- **Gene:** A fragment of information
...- DNA → mRNA → Gene → Genome
- **organism has the largest genome: **Amoeba (670 Gbp)
- **Why Do Humans Have So Few Genes?** large amount of genome not coding for protein
...- **Noncoding RNA:** Canonical ncRNAs, Small ncRNAs, Long ncRNAs (lncRNA)

## Technology
- **Evolution:** S1equencing Technologies
...- Big and HD data

## 3 steps of Bioinformatics
