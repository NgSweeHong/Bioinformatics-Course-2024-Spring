# Bioinformatics Lecture 1
---
- **Textook:** [Bioinformatics Tutorial](https://book.ncrnalab.org/teaching/)

## What To Learn
===
1. Programming Skill
...- Linux, R, Python (Optional)
2. NGS Data Analysis
3. Machine Learning

## Science
===
### This Course Try To Answer:
- Why Do Humans Have So Few Genes?
- To What Extent Are Genetic Variation and Personal Health Linked?

### Gene: Coding & Noncoding
- **Gene:** A fragment of information
...- DNA → mRNA → Gene → Genome
- **organism has the largest genome: **Amoeba (670 Gbp)
- **Why Do Humans Have So Few Genes?** large amount of genome not coding for protein
...- **Noncoding RNA:** Canonical ncRNAs, Small ncRNAs, Long ncRNAs (lncRNA)

## Technology
===
- **Evolution:** S1equencing Technologies
...- Big and HD data

## 3 steps of Bioinformatics
===
1. **Information**
...- Images
...- Sequences
2. **Model**
...- Representation of patterns learned from data.
...- It's built using algorithms.
...- Examples include decision trees, neural networks, etc.
3. **Algorithm**
...- Step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.
...- It's a computational recipe or set of rules.
...- Examples include sorting algorithms, optimization algorithms, etc.

# Bioinformatics study plan for this semester
---
1. Have a deeper understanding of major public databases and where to obtain the required data.
...-such as GEO, Rfam, PDB, etc.
2. Learn the basic pipeline of omics-seq
...- **Goal:** Reproduce at least one RNA-seq article.
3. Master R language
...- At least be able to use R language to complete the questions in the "Applied Statistics and Data Analysis" course
4. Learn ML/DL
...- Master ML such as clustering and regression; basic neural network construction
