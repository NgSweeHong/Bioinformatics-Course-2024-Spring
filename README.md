# Bioinformatics-Course-2024-Spring
**Hi I am Swee Hong, a starter in the field of bioinformatics. This is my very begining to get in touch with what we call computational biology.**\
This repo is all about what I learn in the Bioinformatics course in Tsinghua University.\
It contains any homework and code I write.\
Hopefully I can begin my journey in bioinformatics with a good start.
